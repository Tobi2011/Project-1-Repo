Project Description/Outline
	We will be analyzing whether going to college and receiving a degree is "worth it". We will be comparing different degrees and degree fields and whether if receiving a bachelors or graduate degree in that specific field is worth it by comparing income, and also the number of people with a degree that are in jobs that do not require college degrees. 

Research Question to Answer
	Does your degree gurantee economic success?

What questions are we asking?
	1. What are the 10 highest paying degrees?
	2. What are the 10 lowest paying degrees?
	3. How many men and women are pursuing a particular college degree? 
	4. How does the expected median salary of a particular degree compare with the average salary in Florida?
	5. Which college degrees have the largest amount of people working in jobs that do not require a college degree? 
	
What kind of data do we want?
	1. List of majors and their incomes
	2. Unemployment rate
	3. Number of people working in a field that does not require a college degree.
